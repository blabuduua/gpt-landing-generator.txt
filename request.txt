"Hi, ChatGPT! Please analyze this css and screenshot of a landing page and create self-contained, interchangeable section templates that include HTML, CSS, and JS within the same template. The global HTML tags (`<html>`, `<body>`) and global CSS settings should be written in `base.html`, which is a Python templating file.

The report should contain the following elements:

1. The number of sections on the landing page.
2. The detailed HTML structure, CSS, and JS of each section, all within a single template file for each section.
3. Always include `header.html` and `footer.html` files.
4. Ensure each section template is self-contained with its own HTML. Write the CSS in a `<style>` tag before the HTML content and the JS in a `<script>` tag after the HTML content.
5. Include responsive design considerations for mobile devices in the CSS.
6. If there is a menu, implement a hamburger menu for the mobile version.
7. Extract all texts into a `content.json` file and use templating placeholders in the templates. All texts should be fully written out, avoiding any abbreviations or incomplete phrases. Ensure that all placeholders are written in a flat structure, such as `{{footer_contacts}}` instead of `{{footer.contacts}}`.
8. Write global CSS styles within the `<style>` tag in `base.html` for `*`, `html`, and `body` only.
9. Ensure image paths are written directly in the HTML, following the same convention, e.g., `image_path` instead of `image.path`.
10. Include a `<script>` tag with the necessary JavaScript after the HTML content in each template.

In each template file, there should only be the `<style>`, `header`, `footer`, `section`, and `<script>` tags, with the `<style>` tag before the HTML content and the `<script>` tag after the HTML content.

Here is the css and screenshot.

Please provide a complete report with these details and include the appropriate self-contained template files for each section, ensuring all CSS is within `<style>` tags placed before the HTML content and JS is within `<script>` tags placed after the HTML content in the same template file. Use placeholders in the templates to insert texts from `content.json`, writing the full text in all tags without abbreviations or omissions, and ensuring all placeholder variables are flat, such as `{{footer_contacts}}` instead of `{{footer.contacts}}`."

Please generate a JSON file with new texts for absolutely all keys in the file. Only consider the keys and the requirement that each description should be 500+ characters long, except for headers which should be a single word. The text should be written in the same language as the example text. Here is the example structure for reference:
