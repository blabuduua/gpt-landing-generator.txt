"Hi, ChatGPT! Please analyze this screenshot of a landing page and create self-contained, interchangeable section templates that include HTML, CSS, and JS within the same template. The global HTML tags (<html>, <body>) should be written in base.html, which is a Python templating file.

The report should contain the following elements:

1. The number of sections on the landing page.
2. The detailed HTML structure, CSS, and JS of each section, all within a single template file for each section.
3. Always include header.html and footer.html files.
4. Ensure each section template is self-contained with its own HTML, CSS (within <style> tags written before the HTML), and JS (within <script> tags written after the HTML).
5. Include responsive design considerations for mobile devices in the CSS.
6. If there is a menu, implement a hamburger menu for the mobile version.
7. Extract all texts into a content.json file and use templating placeholders in the templates.
8. Do not write any <style> or <link> tags in base.html; instead, write all global styles directly in each individual template.
9. Ensure image paths are written directly in the HTML.
10. Include a <script> tag with the necessary JavaScript in each template.
11. Write all text content in content.json and reference it using placeholders in the templates. Do not use loops; write out all HTML tags explicitly.

In each template file, the structure should be:
1. <style> tags with CSS before the HTML.
2. <header>, <footer>, <section>, and other HTML tags.
3. <script> tags with JS after the HTML.

Here is the screenshot: [insert image here]

Please provide a complete report with these details and include the appropriate self-contained template files for each section, ensuring all CSS is within <style> tags before the HTML and JS is within <script> tags after the HTML in the same template file. Use placeholders in the templates to insert texts from content.json, and make sure no <style> or <link> tags are in base.html."
